# Table: oci_artifacts_container_repository

OCI Artifacts Container Repositories are a service provided by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for storing and managing container images. These repositories allow you to securely store, share, and deploy container images within OCI. They provide a central location to store and manage your container images, enabling you to easily distribute and deploy them across your OCI environment. OCI Artifacts Container Repositories support popular container image formats and can be integrated with other OCI services such as Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) for seamless container image deployment.
