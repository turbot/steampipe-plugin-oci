# Table: oci_bastion_bastion

A bastion resource. A bastion provides secured, public access to target resources in the cloud that you cannot otherwise reach from the internet. A bastion resides in a public subnet and establishes the network infrastructure needed to connect a user to a target resource in a private subnet.

## Examples

```sql
select
  id,

### Show Bastions that allow access from the Internet (0.0.0.0/0)

```sql
select
  id,

from
  oci_bastion_bastion
where
