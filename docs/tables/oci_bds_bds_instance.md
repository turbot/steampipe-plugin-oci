Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Big Data Service is a fully managed service that allows you to process large amounts of data at the speed of business. It provides a high-performance, secure, and easy-to-use environment for running big data workloads, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, real-time analytics, and data exploration. The service is fully integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, providing seamless access to its data and services.

## Table Usage Guide

The `oci_bds_bds_instance` table provides insights into Big Data Service Instances within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. As a data engineer or data scientist, explore instance-specific details through this table, including the state of the instance, the time it was created, and the shape of nodes. Utilize it to uncover information about instances, such as their network configuration, whether they are in high availability mode, and the type of workload they are designed for.

## Examples

### Basic info
Explore the configuration details of your Big Data Service instances in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. This query helps in understanding the current state, security settings, and other crucial details of each instance for better management and decision-making.

  id,
  display_name,
  number_of_nodes
from
  oci_bds_bds_instance;
```

### List secure clusters
Analyze the settings to understand which clusters are secure in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Big Data Service. This can be particularly useful for ensuring compliance with security policies and identifying potential vulnerabilities.

```sql+postgres
select
  id,
  display_name,
  lifecycle_state,
  is_secure,
  cluster_version,
  created_by
from
  oci_bds_bds_instance
where
  is_secure;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  id,
  display_name,
  lifecycle_state,
  is_secure,
  cluster_version,
  created_by
from
  oci_bds_bds_instance
