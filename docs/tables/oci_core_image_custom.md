# Table: oci_core_image_custom

An image is a template of a virtual hard drive. The image determines the operating system and other software for an instance. You can create a custom image of a bare metal instance's boot disk and use it to launch other instances. Instances you launch from your image include the customizations, configuration, and software installed when you created the image.
