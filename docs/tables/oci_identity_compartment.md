  coalesce(parent.name, 'root') as parent_compartment,
  child.id as id,
  coalesce(parent.id, child.tenant_id) as parent_compartment_id
from
  oci_identity_compartment child
  left join oci_identity_compartment parent on (child.compartment_id = parent.id)
order by
  parent.name;
```

### Full path of the compartments

  where
    lifecycle_state = 'ACTIVE'
  union all
  select
    oci_identity_compartment.name,
    oci_identity_compartment.id,
    oci_identity_compartment.compartment_id,
    oci_identity_compartment.tenant_id,
    oci_identity_compartment.name || '/' || compartments.path,
    compartments.last_name,
    compartments.last_id
  from
    oci_identity_compartment
    join
