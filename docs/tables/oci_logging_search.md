# Table: oci_logging_search

The service offers powerful search capabilities, enabling you to search for specific log entries based on different criteria, such as time range, log content, log source, or custom filters. This helps you quickly locate relevant logs and investigate issues.

**Important notes:**

- By default, this table will provide data for the last 24hrs. You can pass the `timestamp` value in the following ways to fetch data in a range.

  - timestamp >= ‘2023-03-11T00:00:00Z’ and timestamp <= ‘2023-03-15T00:00:00Z’
  - timestamp between ‘2023-03-11T00:00:00Z’ and ‘2023-03-15T00:00:00Z’
  - timestamp >= now() - interval '7 days' (The data will be fetched for the last 7 days)
  - timestamp > ‘2023-03-15T00:00:00Z’ (The data will be fetched from the provided time to the current time)
  - timestamp < ‘2023-03-15T00:00:00Z’ (The data will be fetched from one day before the provided time to the provided time)

- We recommend specifying optional quals in the query to optimize the table output. Optional quals are supported for the following columns:
  - `log_group_name`
  - `log_name`
  - `search_query`
  - `timestamp`
