# Table: oci_resourcemanager_stack

The collection of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources corresponding to a given Terraform configuration. Each stack resides in the compartment you specify, in a single region; however, resources on a given stack can be deployed across multiple regions. An OCID is assigned to each stack.
